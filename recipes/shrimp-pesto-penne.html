    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water when draining; set aside. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, undisturbed. 
            Add in snap peas and stir until shrimp are just becoming opaque. Stir in pesto and cooked pasta until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of lemon zest and the juice of the lemon to the pasta and toss to combine. 
            Add pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency. Serve immediately.</li>
